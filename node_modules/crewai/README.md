## Why CrewAI?

The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

```
npm install crewai
```

### 2. Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use CrewAI:

```typescript
import { Crew, Agent, Task } from 'crewai';

// Create agents
const researcher = new Agent('Researcher', {...});
const writer = new Agent('Writer', {...});

// Create tasks
const researchTask = new Task('Research the topic', {...});
const writeTask = new Task('Write the article', {...});

// Create a crew
const crew = new Crew({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  tasks: [researchTask, writeTask],
});

// Run the crew
const result = crew.run();
console.log(result);
```

## CLI Commands

CrewAI comes with a set of CLI commands to help you manage your crew:

1. Create a new crew or pipeline:
   ```
   crewai create <type> <name> [--router]
   ```

2. Train the crew:
   ```
   crewai train [-n <iterations>] [-f <filename>]
   ```

3. Reset memories:
   ```
   crewai reset-memories [-l] [-s] [-e] [-k] [-a]
   ```

4. Run the crew:
   ```
   crewai run
   ```

5. Replay a task:
   ```
   crewai replay <task_id>
   ```

For more details on each command, use `crewai <command> --help`.
